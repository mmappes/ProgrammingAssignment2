## There are two functions included in this script. Both are used to solve Programming Assignment 2.
## 1.) makeCacheMatrix
## 2.) cacheSolve
## Descriptions for each are provided below.



## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) inv <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() inv
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        inv <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(inv)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(inv)
        inv
}
